    <h3>Emily Im - UX Student</h3>
    <p>
      Hello, my name is Emily Im. I am currently working at a digital media company and a student at UCLA Extension for the User Experience Certification course. I am using a Macbook Air.

      Getting my local and hosting environment up and running was very difficult for me. I had a difficult time adjusting my brain to this new format and not being able to follow along when my screen would not look like Michael's. I had to take a step back and ask my sister for help (She has a background in Fullstack).
